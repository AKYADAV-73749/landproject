## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Flask web framework

### Installation

1. **Install Flask**:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Access the web interface**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### Testing the System

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python test_blockchain_system.py
```

## 🔧 Usage

### 1. Register New Land
- Navigate to "Register Land" in the web interface
- Fill in land details (ID, area, location, type, etc.)
- Provide owner information
- Submit to create a blockchain transaction

### 2. Transfer Ownership
- Go to "Transfer Land" section
- Enter the land ID to transfer
- Specify current and new owner details
- Provide transfer reason and details
- Execute the transfer on blockchain

### 3. View Records
- Access "View Records" to see all registered lands
- Search and filter land records
- Click on any land to view detailed information
- View complete transaction history

### 4. Explore Blockchain
- Visit "Blockchain" section to explore the complete blockchain
- View all transactions and blocks
- Verify blockchain integrity
- Filter transactions by type

## 🔐 Blockchain Technology

### Block Structure
Each block contains:
- **Index**: Sequential block number
- **Transactions**: Array of land-related transactions
- **Timestamp**: Block creation time
- **Previous Hash**: Link to previous block
- **Hash**: Unique block identifier
- **Nonce**: Proof of work value

### Transaction Types
- **Registration**: New land parcel registration
- **Transfer**: Ownership transfer between parties
- **Mining Reward**: Rewards for mining blocks

### Security Features
- **Hash-based Integrity**: SHA-256 hashing for tamper detection
- **Chain Validation**: Continuous verification of blockchain integrity
- **Immutable Records**: Once recorded, transactions cannot be altered
- **Proof of Work**: Mining difficulty ensures security

## 📊 API Endpoints

### REST API
- `GET /api/stats` - Blockchain statistics
- `GET /api/lands` - All registered lands
- `GET /api/land/<land_id>` - Specific land information
- `GET /api/verify` - Verify blockchain integrity

### Web Routes
